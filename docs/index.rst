Welcome to IndeterminateBeam's documentation!
=============================================


``IndeterminateBeam`` is a Python Package aiming to serve as a foundation for civil and structural engineering projects in Python. The module can also serve as a standalone program and is useful for determining: 

  - reaction forces for indeterminate beams
  - internal forces for indeterminate beams (shear, bending, axial)
  - deflection of the beam due to resulting forces
  - axial force, shear force, and bending moment diagrams

The ``indeterminatebeam`` `package repository <https://github.com/JesseBonanno/IndeterminateBeam>`_ can be found on Github and is ready for installation using `pip`.
