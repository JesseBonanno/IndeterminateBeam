=============================================

Okay so why does this project exist?

* Quickly solve indeterminate 1D beam structures.
* Allow for the creation of higher order engineering calculations that inherit from this project. 

This project is based on the `beambending project 
<https://github.com/alfredocarella/simplebendingpractice>`_ by Alfredo Carella which can be used to solve for determinate simply supported structures.
